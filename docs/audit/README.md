# AIxTerm Repository Audit

This directory contains automated audit reports for the AIxTerm codebase.

## Overview

The audit system performs baseline capture and initial classification of the codebase to identify potential areas for improvement, maintenance hotspots, and architectural patterns.

## Generating the Audit

To regenerate the audit baseline:

```bash
# From the project root
make audit-baseline
```

Or run the script directly:

```bash
# From the project root  
python3 scripts/generate_audit.py
```

## Audit Components

The audit report (`audit.md`) contains:

- **Repository Structure**: Directory tree and file organization
- **Language & File Metrics**: Code statistics and largest files
- **Dependency Inventory**: External dependencies and configuration
- **Tooling & Automation**: CI/CD, linting, formatting, and build tools
- **Code Patterns**: Logging, error handling, async/concurrency patterns
- **Code Annotations**: TODO/FIXME/HACK/DEPRECATED comments
- **Maintenance Hotspots**: Large files, potential duplications, and risk areas
- **Findings Classification**: Initial categorization of potential improvements

## Interpreting Results

### Findings Categories

- **Inconsistency**: Code patterns that vary across the codebase
- **Duplication**: Similar code that could be consolidated
- **Legacy/Dead**: Code that may be outdated or unused
- **Risky Pattern**: Code that could lead to bugs or maintenance issues
- **Compat Layer**: Backward compatibility code that could be simplified

### Impact Levels

- **High**: Critical for project maintainability/quality
- **Med**: Moderate impact on development efficiency
- **Low**: Minor improvements or cosmetic issues

### Effort Estimates

- **S (Small)**: 1-4 hours of work
- **M (Medium)**: 1-2 days of work  
- **L (Large)**: Multiple days or weeks of work

## Notes

- The audit script requires a clean git working tree
- If `cloc` is not available, file metrics will be limited
- The audit captures a point-in-time snapshot - regenerate regularly
- Manual review may be needed to validate automated findings
