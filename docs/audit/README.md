# AIxTerm Repository Audit

This directory contains automated audit reports for the AIxTerm codebase.

## Overview

The audit system performs baseline capture and initial classification of the codebase to identify potential areas for improvement, maintenance hotspots, and architectural patterns.

## Generating the Audit

To regenerate the audit baseline:

```bash
# From the project root
make audit-baseline
```

Or run the script directly:

```bash
# From the project root  
python3 scripts/generate_audit.py
```

## Audit Components

The audit report (`audit.md`) contains:

- **Repository Structure**: Directory tree and file organization
- **Language & File Metrics**: Code statistics and largest files
- **Dependency Inventory**: External dependencies and configuration
- **Tooling & Automation**: CI/CD, linting, formatting, and build tools
- **Configuration Discovery**: Environment variables with comprehensive pattern detection
- **Logging Patterns**: Granular logging usage analysis with per-file counts
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Exception handling and error management patterns
- **Async/Concurrency Patterns**: Async and threading usage analysis
- **Code Annotations**: TODO/FIXME/HACK/DEPRECATED comments
- **Potential Duplication Candidates**: Function duplications with detailed metrics
  - Function Duplication Table with file counts and paths
  - Dunder Methods Summary (separated from main risk set)
  - Total distinct candidate counts and truncation logic
- **Test Coverage Surface Mapping**: Static test-to-source mapping
- **Risk & Maintenance Hotspots**: Complex modules and high-annotation areas
- **Phase 1 Findings**: Categorized improvement opportunities

## Phase 2 Enhancements

### Enhanced Pattern Detection (Phase 2 Batch 1)

- **Environment Variables**: Detects all access patterns including assignments
- **Function Duplications**: 126+ distinct candidates with smart truncation
- **Logging Analysis**: Granular per-file metrics for all logging approaches
- **Dunder Method Separation**: Ubiquitous patterns separated from actionable duplicates

### Additional Documentation

- `CHANGELOG_PHASE2.md`: Detailed changes log for Phase 2 enhancements

## Interpreting Results

### Findings Categories

- **Inconsistency**: Code patterns that vary across the codebase
- **Duplication**: Similar code that could be consolidated
- **Dead Code**: Code that may be outdated or unused
- **Risky Pattern**: Code that could lead to bugs or maintenance issues
- **Compat Layer**: Backward compatibility code that could be simplified

### Impact Levels

- **High**: Critical for project maintainability/quality
- **Med**: Moderate impact on development efficiency
- **Low**: Minor improvements or cosmetic issues

### Effort Estimates

- **S (Small)**: 1-4 hours of work
- **M (Medium)**: 1-2 days of work  
- **L (Large)**: Multiple days or weeks of work

## Notes

- The audit script requires a clean git working tree
- If `cloc` is not available, file metrics will be limited
- The audit captures a point-in-time snapshot - regenerate regularly
- Manual review may be needed to validate automated findings
