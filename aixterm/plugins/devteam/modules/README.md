# DevTeam Plugin Modularization

*Created: July 13, 2025*

This directory contains the modularized version of the DevTeam plugin for AIxTerm. The modularization aims to split the large `plugin.py` file (1037 lines) into smaller, more manageable components.

## Design Approach

The modularization follows these principles:
1. **Preserve Original Functionality**: The original `plugin.py` file remains untouched to ensure backward compatibility
2. **Separate Concerns**: Each module handles a specific aspect of plugin functionality
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies between modules are explicit
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Smaller files make maintenance and testing easier
5. **Gradual Adoption**: New code can start using the modular approach while existing code continues to use the original plugin

## Implemented Module Structure

The plugin functionality has been split into the following modules:

### Core Modules
- `types.py`: Type definitions and enums used throughout the plugin
- `config.py`: Configuration handling and management
- `events.py`: Event system for plugin components communication
- `task_manager.py`: Task creation, tracking, and management
- `workflow_engine.py`: Workflow creation, execution, and management

### Implementation Status

- [x] Module directory structure created
- [x] Types module implementation
- [x] Configuration module implementation
- [x] Events module implementation
- [x] Task manager module implementation
- [x] Workflow engine module implementation
- [x] Integration module implementation (plugin_v2.py)

## Module Dependencies

```
plugin_v2.py
├── types.py - Type definitions and enums
├── config.py - ConfigManager
├── events.py - EventBus, Event classes
├── task_manager.py - TaskManager, Task
└── workflow_engine.py - WorkflowEngine, Workflow, WorkflowSteps
```

## Module Details

### types.py
Contains all the enums and type definitions used throughout the plugin, such as TaskType, TaskStatus, WorkflowType, etc.

### config.py
Handles configuration loading, validation, and access for the plugin. Provides methods to get and set configuration values.

### events.py
Implements an event system for communication between plugin components. Provides event publishing and subscription mechanisms.

### task_manager.py
Manages tasks throughout their lifecycle, including creation, status updates, and task relationships.

### workflow_engine.py
Handles workflow creation, execution, and management. Supports different step types and workflow status tracking.

## Usage

The modules are integrated by the `plugin_v2.py` file in the parent directory, which provides a cohesive plugin interface to AIxTerm.
