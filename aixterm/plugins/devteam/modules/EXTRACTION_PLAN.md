# DevTeam Plugin Analysis - Module Extraction Plan

*Created: July 13, 2025*

## Overview

After analyzing the DevTeam plugin (plugin.py, 1037 lines), we've identified several distinct functional areas that can be extracted into separate modules. This document outlines the planned extraction based on the natural boundaries found in the code.

## Current Plugin Structure

The current plugin.py file contains:

1. **Type Definitions**
   - TaskType, TaskPriority, TaskStatus enums

2. **Plugin Class** (DevTeamPlugin)
   - Initialization and shutdown
   - Command registration and handling
   - Task and workflow management
   - Background task processing
   - Adaptive learning integration

3. **Command Handlers**
   - Task submission and management commands
   - Workflow management commands
   - Prompt metrics and experimentation

4. **Task Processing**
   - Task queue management
   - Task state transitions
   - Task execution

5. **Workflow Processing**
   - Workflow template management
   - Workflow execution
   - Workflow state tracking

6. **Agent Management**
   - Agent registration and initialization
   - Agent capacity tracking
   - Agent task assignment

7. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Metrics collection
   - Prompt optimization
   - Experiment tracking

## Module Extraction Plan

Based on the analysis, we'll extract the following modules:

### 1. `modules/base.py` - Core Plugin Structure

```python
class DevTeamPluginBase:
    """Base class for the DevTeam plugin with core functionality."""
    # Plugin properties (id, name, version, etc.)
    # Initialization and shutdown methods
    # Command registration
    # Plugin request handling
    # Background task management
```

### 2. `modules/types.py` - Type Definitions

```python
class TaskType(Enum):
    """Types of development tasks."""
    # Task type definitions

class TaskPriority(Enum):
    """Task priority levels."""
    # Priority level definitions

class TaskStatus(Enum):
    """Task execution status."""
    # Status definitions
```

### 3. `modules/config.py` - Configuration Management

```python
class ConfigManager:
    """Manages plugin configuration."""
    # Configuration loading and validation
    # Default configuration
    # Configuration override methods
    # Configuration access methods
```

### 4. `modules/task.py` - Task Management

```python
class TaskManager:
    """Manages development tasks."""
    # Task creation
    # Task validation
    # Task queue management
    # Task status tracking
    # Task priority handling
```

### 5. `modules/workflow.py` - Workflow Engine

```python
class WorkflowEngine:
    """Manages workflow templates and execution."""
    # Workflow template management
    # Workflow instantiation
    # Workflow state management
    # Workflow execution
```

### 6. `modules/agents.py` - Agent Management

```python
class AgentManager:
    """Manages AI agents and their capacities."""
    # Agent registry management
    # Agent capacity tracking
    # Agent task assignment
    # Agent execution methods
```

### 7. `modules/prompt.py` - Prompt Management

```python
class PromptManager:
    """Manages prompts and prompt optimization."""
    # Prompt template management
    # Prompt generation
    # Prompt context handling
```

### 8. `modules/adaptive.py` - Adaptive Learning

```python
class AdaptiveLearningSystem:
    """Manages adaptive learning for prompt optimization."""
    # Metrics collection
    # Learning algorithms
    # Optimization strategies
    # Experiment tracking
```

### 9. `modules/events.py` - Event Bus System

```python
class EventSystem:
    """Manages the event bus for plugin components."""
    # Event definition
    # Event publishing
    # Event subscription
    # Event handling
```

### 10. `modules/commands.py` - Command Handlers

```python
class CommandHandlers:
    """Handles plugin commands."""
    # Command handler methods
    # Command validation
    # Command response formatting
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Extract Module Files**
   - Create skeleton files for each module
   - Move type definitions and utility functions
   - Create class structures

2. **Refactor Core Logic**
   - Extract methods into appropriate classes
   - Establish clear interfaces between modules
   - Set up dependency injection

3. **Create Plugin V2**
   - Implement a new plugin class that uses the modules
   - Ensure all functionality is preserved

4. **Update Tests**
   - Create unit tests for each module
   - Add integration tests for the modules working together

## Dependencies Between Modules

```
base.py
├── types.py (low coupling)
├── config.py (initialization)
├── task.py (task management)
├── workflow.py (workflow execution)
├── agents.py (agent management)
├── adaptive.py (learning system)
└── commands.py (command handling)

task.py
├── types.py (uses type definitions)
├── events.py (publishes events)
└── agents.py (assigns tasks to agents)

workflow.py
├── task.py (manages tasks within workflow)
├── agents.py (assigns workflow steps to agents)
└── events.py (workflow state events)

agents.py
├── prompt.py (uses prompts for agents)
└── adaptive.py (optimizes agent behavior)

prompt.py
└── adaptive.py (optimizes prompts)

commands.py
├── task.py (task commands)
├── workflow.py (workflow commands)
├── adaptive.py (prompt experiment commands)
└── events.py (command events)
```

## Next Steps

1. Create skeleton files for all modules
2. Extract type definitions into types.py
3. Extract configuration handling into config.py
4. Continue with remaining modules based on dependency order
