# DevTeam Agents

## Overview
The agents module within the DevTeam plugin provides specialized AI agents designed for different aspects of software development. Each agent has domain-specific knowledge and capabilities tailored to particular development tasks.

## Agent Types

### Core Development Agents
- **CodeReviewAgent**: Specialized in code quality analysis and review
- **DebugAgent**: Expert in identifying and resolving bugs and issues
- **ArchitectAgent**: Focused on system design and architectural decisions
- **TestAgent**: Specialized in testing strategies and test automation
- **DevOpsAgent**: Expert in deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure

### Agent Capabilities
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific development areas
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of project structure and patterns
- **Tool Integration**: Access to specialized development tools
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Ability to work together on complex tasks

## Architecture

```

├── __init__.py          # Agent registry and factory
├── base_agent.py        # Base agent interface and common functionality
├── code_review.py       # Code review and quality analysis agent
├── debug.py             # Debugging and troubleshooting agent
├── architect.py         # System design and architecture agent
├── test.py              # Testing and QA agent
└── devops.py            # DevOps and deployment agent
```

## Agent Implementation

### Base Agent Structure
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, name, specialization):
        self.name = name
        self.specialization = specialization
        self.tools = []
    
    def analyze_context(self, context):
        # Agent-specific context analysis
        pass
    
    def generate_response(self, query, context):
        # Specialized response generation
        pass
```

### Specialization Areas
- **Code Quality**: Static analysis, style checking, best practices
- **Bug Detection**: Error pattern recognition, debugging strategies
- **Architecture**: Design patterns, scalability, maintainability
- **Testing**: Test coverage, automation, quality assurance
- **Deployment**: CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring

## Integration Features

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Agent Coordination**: Agents can work together on complex tasks
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Shared understanding of project context
- **Task Distribution**: Automatic assignment based on query type
- **Consensus Building**: Multiple agents can provide different perspectives

### Context Intelligence
- **Project Understanding**: Deep analysis of codebase structure
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of common development patterns
- **Historical Context**: Learning from past interactions and decisions
- **Team Workflow**: Understanding of team practices and preferences

## Usage Patterns

### Single Agent Queries
```bash
aixterm "review this function for potential issues"  # CodeReviewAgent
aixterm "why is my test failing?"                    # DebugAgent
aixterm "how should I structure this module?"        # ArchitectAgent
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
```bash
aixterm "analyze this bug and suggest a fix with tests"
# Involves DebugAgent, CodeReviewAgent, and TestAgent
```

## Performance Characteristics
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Each agent has deep domain expertise
- **Efficient Routing**: Queries automatically routed to appropriate agents
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple perspectives on complex problems
- **Learning Capability**: Agents improve based on project feedback
