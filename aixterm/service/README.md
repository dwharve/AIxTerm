# Service Module

## Overview
The service module provides system-level services and utilities for AIxTerm, including installation, configuration management, and system integration. It handles the operational aspects of AIxTerm deployment and maintenance.

## Key Components

### Service Infrastructure
- **AIxTerm Service**: Main service implementation and lifecycle management
- **Service Server**: HTTP/WebSocket server for client communication
- **Context Manager**: Service-mode context handling and optimization
- **Plugin Manager**: Plugin coordination and management in service mode

### Cross-Platform Installation
- **Windows Service**: Windows service installation using pywin32
- **Linux Systemd**: Linux service installation using systemd
- **macOS Launchd**: macOS service installation using launchd
- **Common Utilities**: Shared installation logic and platform detection

## Core Functionality

### Service Management
- **Service Installation**: Cross-platform service installation and registration
- **Process Lifecycle**: Service startup, shutdown, and restart handling
- **Configuration Management**: Service-specific configuration and settings
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks and status reporting

### Communication Layer
- **HTTP Server**: RESTful API for client communication
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent routing of client requests
- **Response Streaming**: Efficient streaming of AI responses

### Maintenance Operations
- **Health Checks**: System health monitoring and diagnostics
- **Cleanup Services**: Temporary file and cache management
- **Backup Operations**: Configuration and data backup utilities
- **Update Management**: Seamless updates and version migrations

## Integration Points
- **Main Module**: Uses services for system-level operations
- **Config Module**: Integrates with configuration management services
- **Integration Module**: Coordinates with shell integration services
- **CLI**: Provides service commands for installation and maintenance

## Platform Support
- **Linux**: Full support for all major distributions
- **macOS**: Native integration with macOS shell environments
- **Windows**: PowerShell and WSL support
- **Cross-Platform**: Unified API across all supported platforms

## Security Considerations
- **Privilege Management**: Minimal required permissions
- **Secure Installation**: Verification of installation integrity
- **Credential Protection**: Safe handling of API keys and tokens
- **Audit Logging**: Track system-level operations and changes
