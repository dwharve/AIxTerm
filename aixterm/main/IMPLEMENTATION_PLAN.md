# Main Module Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a plan to modularize the `main.py` file (652 lines) into smaller, more manageable components.

## Current Structure

`main.py` currently contains:

1. The `AIxTerm` class with core functionality:
   - Initialization and setup
   - Signal handling
   - Response handling
   - Progress reporting
   - Tool management
   - CLI and shell integration
   - Configuration management
   
2. The `main()` function for CLI entry point

## Modularization Plan

We'll split the file into the following modules:

### 1. `app.py` (Core Application)
- Main `AIxTerm` class with core initialization
- Basic configuration and component setup
- Shutdown handling
- Simple run methods

### 2. `cli.py` (CLI Interface)
- Command-line interface implementation
- CLI mode handling
- Argument parsing
- Main entry point

### 3. `shell_integration.py` (Shell Integration)
- Shell integration installation/uninstallation
- Shell specific configurations
- Path management for shell scripts

### 4. `tools_manager.py` (Tools Management)
- Tool listing and management
- Tool response handling
- Progress callback implementation

### 5. `status_manager.py` (Status and Diagnostics)
- Status reporting
- Cleanup handling
- Context management

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the module directory structure
2. Extract related functionality into each module
3. Implement proper imports and dependencies
4. Update tests to reflect the new structure
5. Verify all functionality works as expected

## Directory Structure

```
aixterm/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── app.py             # Core application (replaces main.py)
  ├── cli.py             # CLI interface and entry point
  ├── shell_integration.py  # Shell integration functionality
  ├── tools_manager.py   # Tool management and callbacks
  └── status_manager.py  # Status reporting and maintenance
```

## Dependencies

- app.py will be imported by cli.py
- All modules may depend on common utilities
- Each module will expose clear interfaces for integration

## Migration Path

1. Create new modules with stub implementations
2. Gradually move code from main.py to the appropriate modules
3. Update imports and dependencies
4. Ensure main.py still works as an alias during transition
5. Finally, convert main.py to import from the new modules

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each new module
2. Integration tests to verify all features still work
3. End-to-end tests to confirm CLI behavior

## Completion Criteria

1. No single file is over 300 lines
2. All functionality is preserved
3. All tests pass
4. Documentation is updated to reflect new structure
